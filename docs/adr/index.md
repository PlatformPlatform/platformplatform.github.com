# Architecture Decision Records

We use the concept of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document the decisions that we make in the development of the PlatformPlatform project.

An Architecture Decision Record is a short text file in a format that makes it easy to compare different decisions. Each record describes a set of forces and a decision in response to those forces. The decision is the answer to the question: "What is the best way to address these forces?"

We use the standard format for ADRs as described in the [Architecture Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/) website.
