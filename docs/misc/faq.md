## Will PlatformPlatform support other service providers?

PlatformPlatform is designed to be a enterprise grade, secure and compliant.
We have no plans to support other service providers than Azure.

That said the project consists of infrastructure, .Net Core and React TypeScript -
it's possible to fork the project and modify it to support other service providers.
But you would be loosing the benefits of the PlatformPlatform project as it's
tailored to work well together.
